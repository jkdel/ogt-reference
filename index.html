  <h2>Background</h2>
  <details>
  <summary>
    The <strong>equine metabolic syndrome</strong> (<strong>EMS</strong>)
    consists of a range of metabolic disorders predisposing horses and ponies
    to laminitis. The term <strong>insulin dysregulation</strong> describes an
    exacerbated insulin response to oral carbohydrates and may therefore
    involve incretin signalling. It is one of the central components of EMS
    alongside regional or generalized obesity. 
  </summary>
  <p>
    <strong>Insulin resistance</strong> results from an altered response of
    peripheral tissues to insulin and is associated with insulin dysregulation.
    However, not every horse suffering from insulin dysregulation is insulin
    resistant. Therefore, diagnostic tests for EMS should not rely solely on
    insulin sensitivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Protocol for the <strong>oral glucose test</strong> (<strong>OGT</strong>):
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Let the horse fast overnight.</li>
    <li>Collect a basal blood sample.</li>
    <li>
      Administer 1 g glucose/kg bodyweight in 2L of water via nasogastric
      tubing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Collect a second sample around 120 min (maximal range 90 and 180 min). The
      horse should not be allowed to eat in the meantime.
    </li>
    <li>
      Analyze the samples for glucose and insulin. The latter should be measured
      using the Mercodia<sup>&reg;</sup> Equine Insulin ELISA to ensure the
      obtention of a valid diagnosis based on the here provided reference range.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    In contrast to tests like the <strong>combined glucose/insulin test</strong>
    (<strong>CGIT</strong>), this test has the advantage of being more
    practical to perform in a field environment and to assess postprandial
    hyperinsulinaemia under standardized conditions. Furthermore, in contrast to
    intravenous glucose infusion, enteral glucose can activate
    <strong>incretin</strong> signalling. Therefore, <strong>the OGT is better
    suited to detect insulin dysregulation</strong> than other test, while the
    other tests are more relevant for insulin resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    This web app is derived from a <a href="#paper">paper</a> that tries to provide
    a <strong>more consistent reference range for insulin</strong> during the
    OGT. In addition, it <strong>alleviates the requirements on timing</strong> by
    providing a <strong>dynamic reference range for insulin at any time-point
    between 90 and 180 minutes</strong>, instead of 120 min only.
    <strong>The reference range is currently only available for insulin measured
    using the Mercodia<sup>&reg;</sup> Equine Insulin ELISA</strong>. If you
    struggle finding a laboratory using this assay you can contact our <a

  <p>
    <strong>Insulin dysregulation</strong> is a central part of the
    <strong>equine metabolic syndrome</strong> and can be detected using the OGT.
    However, it might also occur in horses affected by <strong>pituitary pars
    intermedia dysfunction</strong> (<strong>PPID</strong>), formerly known as
    <strong>equine Cushing syndrome</strong>. This is why horses that were
    found positive in the OGT and could be affected by PPID (age, other
    clinical signs) should also be tested (e.g. by <strong>TRH stimulation
    test</strong>), and if necessary treated, for this disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    The management of patients with EMS mostly consists of an
    <strong>optimization of the diet and exercise</strong>. Energy intake has to
    be reduced gradually and adapted to the horse's actual needs, which are
    sometimes difficult to evaluate for the owner. Exercise is
    not limited to more intense training but also includes changes in the
    stables like access to a paddock, more space for social interaction or
    putting obstacles in the paddock to make the route from roughage to water
    circuitous etc. Specific advice and suggestions can be found in the
    literature.
