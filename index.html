  <h2>Background</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>The <strong>Equine Metabolic Syndrome</strong> <strong>(EMS)</strong>
    consists in a range of metabolic disorders predisposing horses and ponies
    for laminitis.</summary> The term <strong>Insulin dysregulation</strong> describes an
    exacerbated insulin response to orally available sugars and may therefore
    involve incretin signalling. It is one of the central components of EMS
    alongside with regional or generalized obesity.
  </details>
  <p>
    <strong>Insulin resistance</strong> results from a damaged response of
    peripheral tissues to insulin and is asociated with insulin dysregulation. It
    is however not present in every horse suffering from insulin dysregulation,
    nor is every horse having an insulin resistance insulin dysregulated. This is
    why diagnostical tests for EMS should not rely solely on insulin-sensitivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Oral Glucose Test</strong> <strong>(OGT)</strong> consists in
    the administration of 1 g glucose/kg bodyweight in 2L of water via
    nasogastric tubing. Blood samples for insulin measurments are drawn prior to
    the tubing and 120 min after it. In contrast to tests like the
    <strong>Combined Glucose/Insulin Test</strong> <strong>(CGIT)</strong>, this
    test has the advantages of being more practical to perform in a field
    environnement and to activate <strong>incretin signaling</strong>. The
    activation of incretin signaling is not achieved by intravenous glucose
    infusion, this why <strong>the OGT is probably better suited to detect
    insulin dysregulation</strong>, while the other tests are more relevant for
    insulin sensitivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Webapp is based on a <a href="#paper">paper</a> which tries to provide a
    <strong>more consistent reference range for insulin</strong> during the OGT.
    Further, by modelling the insulin answer of approximately 30 horses
    considered healthy during the OGT, it is capable of <strong>alleviating the
    requirements on timing</strong>. Actually, drawing the second blood sample
    exactly 120 min after the tubing might not be achievable outside of a
    hospital. This App provides a <strong>reference for insulin at any
    time-point between 90 and 180 minutes</strong>. These references are
    currently only available for insulin measured using the Mercodia Equine
    Insulin ELISA.

  <h2>More informations</h2>
  <p>
    Insulin dysregulation is a central part of the Equine Metabolic Syndrome and
    can be detected using an Oral Glucose Test. However it might also occur in
    horses affected by Pars Pituitary Intermedia Deficiency (PPID), formerly
    known as Equine Cushing Syndrome. This is why horses that where found
    positiv in the OGT and could possibly be affected by PPID (age, other
    clinical signs) should also be tested, and if necessary treated, for this
    disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    The managment of patients with EMS mostly consists in an optimisation of
    the diet and exercise. Energy intake has to be reduced gradually and adapted
    to the horse's actual needs, which are sometimes difficult to evaluate for
    the owner. Exercising of the horse is not limited to a more intense training
    but also includes changes in the stables like access to a paddock, more
    space for social interaction or putting obstacles in the paddock to make the
    route from roughage to water more circuitous etc. More specific advices and
    suggestions can be found in literatur.
